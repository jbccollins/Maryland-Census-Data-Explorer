# Maryland Census Data Explorer
A Shiny app that lets the user subset, filter and visualize Maryland census data from 2012 and 2013.

[Here it is in action!](https://jbccollins.shinyapps.io/census-app/)

Note: The page may take a few seconds to load as it needs to fetch/build large data frames. Also... The predictive modeling in the app was done for a class project so take it as you will.
